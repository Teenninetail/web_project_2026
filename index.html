                <h2>intro into virtual machine</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Virtual machine is a software that let you emulate the computer operating system and application within an isolated environment. 
                Inseated of relying directly on phsical computer hardware, virtual machine use hypervisor layer to abstract and allocate resource such as CPU, memory, and storage. 
                And this allow the single physical computer to run multiple virtual machines simultaneously.
            </p>
            <p>There are two categories of hypervisors that is used to manage virtual machines: Type 1 (native or bare-metal) and Type 2 (hosted).
                type 1 hypervisor run directly on the host physical hardware and are commonly deployed in enterprise data center.
                type 2 hypervisor run on top of the exising host operating system and are used for development, testing and education purpose.
            </p>
            <p>Virtual machines play a critcal role in cloud computing, cybersecurity testing, and system development.
                They enable developer to create and test software in a controlled environment, isolate potential security threats, and optimize resource utilization across multiple workloads.
                For example, debian based system administration in virtual machine allow student to experiment and configure their system without risking damage to their primary operating system.
